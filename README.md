# Correcting_Image_Distortion
This repository contains a Python script for image processing using OpenCV
 The script reads images from a specified folder, corrects distortion using given camera matrix and distortion coefficients, rotates the images by a specified angle, draws a grid on them, and then saves them to a specified output folder.

## Introduction

In digital image processing, correcting image distortion is crucial for accurate representation. This script focuses on undoing the distortion in images and performing additional processing like rotation and drawing grid lines, which can be useful in various applications like computer vision, robotics, and photography.

## Usage

- Ensure you have Python installed along with required libraries: OpenCV and NumPy.
- Replace the input and output folder paths with your folder paths.
- Run the script: `python image_processing.py`

## Script Overview

The Python script named `image_processing.py` reads images from the `input_folder`, undistorts, rotates, draws a grid, and saves them in the `output_folder`.
